This project looks to scrape the official data and figures of the daily Covid-19 activity in India and write the data into a google sheet.

The data is scraped from the government website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India using bs4 and is written into a google sheet, using the Google Drive and Google Sheet APIs. In the sheet you can see the rise/fall in total cases, deaths, recoveries and active cases for each day.
